@dataclass
class BatchStash(TorchMultiProcessStash, SplitKeyContainer, Writeback,
                 Deallocatable, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """A stash that vectorizes features in to easily consumable tensors for
    training and testing.  This stash produces instances of :class:`.Batch`,
    which is a batch in the machine learning sense, and the first dimension of
    what will become the tensor used in PyTorch.  Each of these batches has a
    logical one to many relationship to that batche's respective set of data
    points, which is encapsulated in the :class:`.DataPoint` class.

    The stash creates subprocesses to vectorize features in to tensors in
    chunks of IDs (data point IDs) from the subordinate stash using
    ``DataPointIDSet`` instances.

    To speed up experiements, all available features configured in
    ``vectorizer_manager_set`` are encoded on disk.  However, only the
    ``decoded_attributes`` (see attribute below) are avilable to the model
    regardless of what was created during encoding time.

    The lifecycle of the data follows:

    1. Feature data created by the client, which could be language features,
       row data etc.

    2. Vectorize the feature data using the vectorizers in
       ``vectorizer_manager_set``.  This creates the feature contexts
       (``FeatureContext``) specifically meant to be pickeled.

    3. Pickle the feature contexts when dumping to disk, which is invoked in
       the child processes of this class.

    4. At train time, load the feature contexts from disk.

    5. Decode the feature contexts in to PyTorch tensors.

    6. The model manager uses the ``to`` method to copy the CPU tensors to the
       GPU (where GPUs are available).
